            <h1>3D Maze Generation</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For my Dissertation as part of my degree, I created algorithms to both create and solve 3D cube (n-by-n-by-n) Mazes.</p>
            <p>As part of this project I researched the history of mazes and maze generation, as well as the real-world applications of
            generation and solving algorithms.</p>
            <h2>My Artefact</h2>
            <p>To create said algorithms, I took the concept of trees in graph theory and applied it to mazes. We can imagine the nodes
            in a tree as potential corners or junctions in a maze, and the vertices as the paths which connect them.
            We can also imagine the root node as the entrance of the maze, and select one leaf node to be the exit.
            There is only one path between the root and a specific leaf node in a tree, so we can use this to create a perfect maze
            (a perfect maze being a maze with no loops.</p>
            <p>Some alterations will need to be made to the tree however. Instead of a node having a maximum of two children, for a 3D maze they
            will have a maximum of five (and always one parent node).</p>
            <p>Now we can use graph theory algorithms to build and solve these mazes. In my case I used algorithms such as prim's and depth first search
            to create the mazes and breadth first search to solve them.</p>
            <p>To compare the effectiveness of the algorithms against one another I used tableau to create visualisations comparing the mazes using data retrieved from the algorithms.
            Comparisons include number of dead ends to analyse the difficulty of a maze and time to build to measure the speed of the algorithms.</p>
            <p>I also looked into further avenues of research for this project. I would like to explore building these mazes in a 3D environment to create interactive mazes,
            and possibly create an artificial intelligence to analyse a humans inputs when solving a maze to mimic a human solving a maze.
            I believe this would enable me to more effectively analyse the difficulty of a maze.</p>
